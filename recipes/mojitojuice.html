   <h1>Mojito cocktail Juice</h1> <br>
   <img src="mojito.jpg" alt=""><br>
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p><strong>The Mojito</strong> is a classic cocktail known for its refreshing and vibrant flavors.<br>
     It is a popular drink originating from Cuba and has gained worldwide popularity for <br>
     its combination of mint, lime, rum, and soda water. The Mojito is often enjoyed on warm <br>
     summer days or as a tropical escape in any season.<br>
     The drink starts with the base of white rum, which provides a smooth and slightly sweet alcoholic kick.<br>
      Freshly squeezed lime juice adds a zesty and tangy flavor that balances the sweetness of the other ingredients.<br>
       Granulated sugar is used to enhance the sweetness, and it is muddled together with fresh mint leaves to release<br>
        their aromatic oils and create a refreshing herbal essence.</p>
